# Chauffeur Mod Manager

This is a mod management program for Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom! This project requires the user to install the
[Chauffeur Modding Library](https://github.com/alwaysintreble/Chauffeur) (this process is automated) in order to browse
the available mods. Currently, this only supports downloading known available mods. Updating and removing mods TBD.

# Installation

Simply grab the [latest release](https://github.com/alwaysintreble/chauffeur_mod_manager/releases/latest), unzip it
wherever you like, and enjoy! You need to point to the path of the game in the settings so somewhere near your game
install (or in the same folder) is recommended.
